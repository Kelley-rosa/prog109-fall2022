                <h2>About Me</h2>

                <h4>Where are you from?</h4>
                <p>I was born and raised in San Antonio, Texas. In the fall of 2021, I moved to Redmond, Washington.</p>

                <h4>In how many languages can you say "hello"?</h4>
                <p>Four. Hello (English), Hola (Spanish), Kon'nichiwa (Japanese), and Hallo (German).<br>
                    But I'm only fluent in English. I, however, may or may not be able to understand you if you're talking to me in Spanish. </p>
                
                <h4>What are you academic and professional goals?</h4>
                <p>My dream is graduate with a Bachelors in Computer Science. From there I'd want to have small jobs in big companies.<br>
                    I rather do this so I can make money doing what I enjoy<br>
                    but not have too much responsibility that I can't enjoy life. </p>
                
                <h4>Who would you most like to meet in real life?</h4>
                <p>I would most like to meet Ludwig van Beethoven. I would love to hear his music either played or directed by him.<br>
                    Also, I'd like to know what his personality is really like.</p>
                
                <h4>What’s the last thing that made you laugh out loud?</h4>
                <p>For backstory, I recently visited cousin that I had not seen in a long time. We played air hockey. <br>
                    As time went on, the game became silly in the sense that no one could score.<br>
                    No matter how close the puck came to the goal, something ridicules would happen and the score remained as was.</p>
                
                <h4>Where would you most like to go on vacation?</h4>
                <p>I would most like to go to Panama to fulfill a desire a friend of mine had before his passing. </p>
                    
                <h4>What’s your earliest memory?</h4>
                <p>My earliest memory is almost drowning in a pool. Emphasis on the "almost". I remember choosing to jump in the deep end.<br>
                    I was immediately pulled out of the water by my dad. Everyone was looking at me worried and I didn’t understand why. </p>
                
                <h4>What is the best gift you have ever received?</h4>
                <p>A puppy I named Copper (from Fox and the Hound). He was a surprise gift from my parents.</p>
                
                <h4>If you had a time machine, would you travel to the past of the future?</h4>
                <p>The past. I'd go back to see the precious things I missed from trying to get to the future too quickly.</p>
