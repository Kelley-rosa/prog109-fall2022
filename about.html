                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    <h4>Who would you most like to meet in real life?</h4>
                    I would most like to meet Ludwig van Beethoven. I would love to hear his music either played or directed by him. Also, I'd like to know what his personality is turly like.
                    
                    <h4>What’s the last thing that made you laugh out loud?</h4>
                    For backstory, I ecently visted cousin that I had not seen in a long time. We played air hockey. As time went on, the game became silly in the sense that no one could score.<br>
                    No matter how close the puck came to the goal, something ridicouls would happen and the score remaind as was. 

                    <h4>Where would you most like to go on vacation?</h4>
                    I would most like to go to Panama to fullfil a desire a friend of mine had before his passing. 
                    
                    <h4>What’s your earliest memory?</h4>
                    My earliest memory is almost drowning in a pool. Emphisis on the "almost". I remember choosing to jump in the deep end then immediatly being pulled out of the water by my dad.<br>
                    Everyone was looking at me worried and I didnt understand why. 
                    
                    <h4>What is the best gift you have ever received?</h4>
                    A puppy I named Copper (from Fox and the Hound). He was a surpise gift from my parents. 

                    <h4>If you had a time machine, would you travel to the past of the future?</h4>
                    The past. I'd go back to see the precious things I missed from trying to get to the future too quickly. 

                    <h4>What are you academic and professional goals?</h4>
                    My dream is graduate with a Bachlors in Computer Science. From there I'd want to have small jobs in big companies. I rather do this so I can make money doing what I enjoy<br>
                    but not have too much resposibiity that I can't enjoy life. 
                    
                    <h4>In how many languages can you say "hello"?</h4>
                    Four. Hello (english), hola(spanish), Kon'nichiwa(japanese), and hallo(german).<br>
                    But I'm only fluent in English. I, however, may or may not be able to understand you if you're talking to me in spanish. 
                    
                    <h4>Where are you from?</h4>
                    I was born and raised in San Antonio, Texas. In the fall of 2021, I moved to Redmond, Washington.
