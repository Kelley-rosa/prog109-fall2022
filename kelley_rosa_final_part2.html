                    <b>What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?</b>
                    <dd>
                        In high school, I took a multimedia communications class that went over basic Html and CSS. 
                        In that class, we used a Adobe Dreamweaver. Again, it was very basic. For example, we would use images for buttons. 
                        I've also used Codecademy to go over the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                        For three years, I worked as an intern for a grocery company in Texas called H-E-B. 
                        There, I was given the task to create a pre-designed internal department website. 
                        This was a unique task. I had to recreate what the company wanted within a pre-existing application. 
                        To do so, I needed to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but was restricted because I had to work within the confides of a very old version of SharePoint.

                    <b>Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch?</b>
                    <dd>
                        I used one of the templates provided. However, I did strip it down to changed add to the structure and style of the page.

                    <b>What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)</b>
                    <dd>
                        The most challenging part of the portfolio was the form validation and other JavaScript integrations. 
                        As you can see from my background, I am least familiar with JavaScript. 
                        While past knowledge of other coding languages helped, it was still a challenge to incorporate JavaScript.

                    <b>How has taking this class changed your view on Web Development?</b>
                    <dd>
                        I have a very positive view of Web Development. I would say this class hasnâ€™t changed that. 
                        This class allowed me to establish a well-rounded foundation in Web Development that I was lacking. 
                        I now feel most confident in my future endeavors with Web Development.

                    <b>What would you recommend to future students taking this class?</b>
                    <dd>
                        This is had to say, because I had some prior knowledge of the languages to taking this class.
                        I would say that because of that, I did not feel overwhelmed when faced with challeges.
                        Becuase of that, my advice would be to utilize other resources like Codeacdemy that might explain the same material in a different way.
